## 1. Introduction
This GitHub repository hosts an end-to-end data science project that focuses on the analysis and prediction of flight status using binary classification techniques. The project comprises two main components: 
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline

  
Machine learning classifier such as :
- XGBoost
- Bernoullie Naive Base
- Random Forest



The aim of this project is to perform binary classication into following classes:



- Flight is Cancelled (Positive class or 1)
- Fligh is'nt Cancelled ( Negative class or 0)

## 3. Dataset

- The data consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. This is a large dataset: there are nearly 120 million records in total and takes up 1.6 gigabytes of space when compressed and 12 gigabytes when uncompressed.
- Data was extracted using Kaggle's API 
- You can find the dataset here: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedelsayedrashad/airline-on-time-performance-data/code?datasetId=3670668&sortBy=dateRun&tab=profile>
