## 1. Introduction
This project's code is also available on Kaggle, where it was collaboratively developed by Khushal Sharma and Venkat Anand Sai Duggi. You can access and interact with the codes on Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/venkatanandsaid/airline-on-time-data-preprocessing">Data-Preprocessing</a>, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/kms025/airline-on-time-classification">Classification-Task</a>

This GitHub repository hosts an end-to-end data science project that focuses on the analysis and prediction of flight status using binary classification techniques. The project comprises two main components:


  
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline

  
Machine learning classifier such as :


- XGBoost
- Bernoullie Naive Base
- Random Forest



The aim of this project is to perform binary classication into following classes:



- Flight is Cancelled (Positive class or 1)
- Fligh is'nt Cancelled ( Negative class or 0)

## 3. Dataset

- The data consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. This is a large dataset: there are nearly 120 million records in total and takes up 1.6 gigabytes of space when compressed and 12 gigabytes when uncompressed.
- Data was extracted using Kaggle's API 
- You can find the dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedelsayedrashad/airline-on-time-performance-data/code?datasetId=3670668&sortBy=dateRun&tab=profile">here</a>
